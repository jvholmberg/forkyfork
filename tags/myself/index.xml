      <description>Okay so to be completely honest I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a plan for this site. Is it supposed to be a blog or just something static occupying my domain, I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip;
I just accidently stumbled upon this thing called hugo that is a tool for generating websites and wanted to give it a go. And here we are now. So far it seems pretty neat, this thing took about 10mins to get up and running.</description>

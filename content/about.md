description: Who am I?

My name is `Johan Holmberg` and I come from a small village about 2 miles outside of Älmhult.
You might have heard of it, You know the place where IKEA is from. Well enough about that.

I have been working as a developer for the last 5 years and is currently employed by Sigma which is a large consultancy bureu here in Sweden.
There I am a member of a team which specialize in frontend technologies. Which in my case means `React` with external
libraries such as `Redux`, `Ìmmutable`, `styled-components`.

But I also have also previous experience from backend working with `.NET` and mobile applications using `Swift`, `Java` and `Cordova`.

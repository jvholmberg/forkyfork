Okay so to be completely honest I don't really have a plan for this site.
Is it supposed to be a blog or just something static occupying my domain, I don't know...

I just accidently stumbled upon this thing called hugo that is a tool for generating websites and wanted to give it a go.
And here we are now. So far it seems pretty neat, this thing took about 10mins to get up and running. Thats is however not including setting up the A and CNAME records needed in the DNS-registry to use my domain. That is since I always ends up messing something up when fiddling with those.

Over and out!
